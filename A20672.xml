            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>It may ſeeme ſtrange vnto thee, that an <hi>Hermit,</hi> whoſe entertainment and conuerſation, ought chiefly to be in ſolitude, meditation, &amp; contemplation, should trouble himſelfe in his <hi>Cell,</hi> with the turbulent controuerſies of this tyme, in matters of faith which in former ages, when innocencie, and vertue moſt florished, euery Chriſtian receaued with his baptiſme, after most conſtantly to hould and profeſſe the ſame, all the dayes of his life. yet ſo it fell out, that in conuerſing with dyuers <hi>Puritans,</hi> I found by experience, that out of ignorance and want of knowledge what our viſible ſacrifice is, by whome it was instituted or to what end, they hate it, more then they doe Iudaiſme, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme, or Paganiſme it ſelfe, in ſuch ſort, that they obiect our offering of viſible Sacrifice, as one of the chiefeſt cauſes of their alienation from vs; when in truth, and veritie, exterior viſible ſacrifice, is the cheef exterior viſible honor, which is due to God, as he is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16848:4"/> God, and Creator of all things, as will appeare by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, if we shall paſſe through all the exterior viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worships, reſpects, &amp; reuerences, which are vſed by men in this life: and it is ſo due vnto God alone, that it may not be giuen vnto any Creature, or falſe God, vnder penaltie of high treaſon againſt his Deuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, punishable by death as witneſſeth his lavv, and euerlaſting decree ſaging. <hi>He that ſacrificeth to Gods shall be put to death: But to our Lord only.</hi> So that the firſt motiue, which moued me to wryte of this ſubiect, was the groſſe ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and blindneſſe I found in many <hi>Puritans,</hi> who commonly would bitterly inueigh against our viſible ſacrifice, not knowing what it was, nor wherfore it was inſtituted; for otherwyſe I ſuppoſe they would not be ſo vehement againſt the honour of God: &amp; therfore thought with my ſelfe, for the honor of God, and good of their ſoules, to wryte plainly and manifeſtly of this ſubiect, without any flourishing words, or loftineſſe of ſtyle, or farr fetcht inuentions, to make euery well minded ſimple Protestant, or Puritan (who will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyghted with truth) capable to perceaue and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the exterior viſible ſacrifice, or <hi>Maſſe,</hi> which he ſo much hateth is the cheef exterior viſible wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp, which doth belong vnto God alone, that he may
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16848:4"/> alſo defend the honor of God and not oppoſe it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the emminencie &amp; excellencie of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Alter is ſo greate, that <hi>S.

Which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered &amp; fynding the paſsion of the Puritans of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo furious againſt this ſaid Sacrament of the Alter as to eſteeme the reuerence &amp; reſpect, which is due vnto it, Idolatrie, and ſo to perſecute it, that if it lay in their poners, they would not only extirpate it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16848:5"/> out of this Iland of great Britanie, but out of the whole globe of the earth, to bring in their fancie of eating a peece of bakers bread: The honour of my lord, the ſaluation of their ſoules, and the lyfe of my Countrie, moued me to abſtract ſome howers from my ordinarie recollections, to defend with my penne the dignitie of ſo emminent a Sacrament. If this worke of myne fall short of thyne expectation, accept of my good will, which is, if it were in my poner, te giue all honor vnto God vnto whome all honor and glorie is due, and vnto thee, Reader, lyfe of eternall lyfe: and ſo Ireſt thy ſeruant in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

Chapter of his 10. booke of the Cittie of God, not onely ſignifieth; but alſo in the 19. Chapter of the ſame booke further expreſſeth, ſaying: <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Viſible Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, ſignes of the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as vvords of thinges.</note> 
                        <hi>Sacrifices are ſignes of the inuiſible, as ſounding wordes are ſignes of things; wherefore as when we pray or praiſe, we direct the ſignefying words vnto him, to whom we offer the thing ſignified in our hearts: So when we ſee men offering</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>we know that viſible Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, ought not to be offered vnto anie other, but vnto him, whoſe inuiſible Sacrifice we our ſelues ought to be in our hearts.</hi> Thus <hi>S.

And therefore, as when men ſpeake words to God, they ought to haue the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in their hearts, which their articulate or ſounding wordes doe ſignifie: ſo lykewyſe, when men offer exterior viſible Sacrifice, they are oble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to haue an inward and inuiſible Sacrifice of their hearts to God, thereby to acknowledge him for their Lord God, and to manifeſt his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer them, and their ſubiection vnto him: becauſe viſible Sacrifices are ſignes of the <note place="margin">God acknovv<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledged for God, by viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifice.</note> inuiſible of our hearts, as wordes are of things, and ought not to be offered vnto any, but vnto
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16848:9"/> him, whoſe inuiſible ſacrifyce we our ſelues ought to be in our hearts. And to whom man offereth the inuiſible Sacrifice of his heart, him he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth for his God, Creator, &amp;c.

Wherevpon it cometh to paſſe, that the offering of viſible Sacrifyce, is worſhipp of Latria, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhipp, which is due vnto God only, as I ſhall ſhew more at large hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="7">7.

                     <p n="8">8.

                     <p n="9">9.

And conſidering that for the good of man kind, it was neceſſarie, there ſhould be ſome outward viſible thing inſtituted, which might not only priuatly preſerue in euerie one, the honor and loue of God and his neighbour; but alſo maintaine a publicke practiſe of the honor of God, memorie of the paſſion of our Lord, and vnitie amongſt all his ſeruants; in what ſacred outward viſible ſigne could it better be expreſſed, then in a viſible Sacrifice, repreſenting the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of the paſſion of our Lord, and the inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifice of our heartes which were the actes, and ſacred obſeruations of our reconliacion, and peace with God by the ſufferings of our ſauiour vpon the Croſſe.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If anie obiect, and ſay that the Scriptures, <note place="margin">Hovv God doth deſire Sacrifice, and not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re it.</note> often affirme, that God doth not deſire Sacrifice: this obiection, <hi>S. Auguctine</hi> anſwereth, in the aforeſaid chapter, prouing by manie examples of Scripture; that when it is ſaid, God doth not require Sacrifice; it is to be vnderſtood, of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16848:10"/> viſible ſigne, (which is commonly called the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice) when it is without the inuiſible Sacrifice of our hearts; for ſo it is but a falſe ſigne, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie; ſuch as was the ſacrifice of <hi>Cain,</hi> who offered his goods, as a viſible ſigne, but not his heart, in an inuiſible Sacrifice; and therefore his ſacrifice, was reiected, and Abells accepted; as witneſſeth <hi>Rupertus,</hi> (in his 4. book vpon Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, and ſecond chapter) ſaying: <hi>By faith,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Paul, Abel offered a greater host then Cain; for in exterior worshipp, and religion, they both offered alike. And therefore, both of them offered rightlie: but Cain did not rightly deuide; for Cain whileſt he offered his goods to God, kept himſelf vnto himſelf, hauing his heart fixed in earthly deſires. Such portions, or outward gifts, God doth not accept of; but by himſelfe ſaith</hi> (in the 23. of the Prouerbes) <hi>Sonne giue vnto me thy heart. Wherefore, Abel firſt offered vnto God his heart, and then his goods; and ſo offered by faith, a greater hoſt then Cain:</hi> Who offered the outward Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which was the viſible ſigne: but kept the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which God moſt eſteemed, vnto himſelfe.</p>

And yet ſaith, that ſome kinde of prayer, is hipocriſie, <hi>(Math.</hi> 15. 7.) In like manner, God ſo affecteth Sacrifice, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der penaltie of death, he prohibiteth it to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto anie, but vnto himſelfe; <hi>(Exod.</hi> 22. 20.) and yet ſaith, that he will not haue Sacrifice offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16848:11"/> vnto him; <hi>(Iſay</hi> 1. 12.) The reaſon is, for that exterior prayer (which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called prayer) is a ſigne of the interior prayer of the heart, which when it wanteth, is hipocriſie, as a falſe ſigne: So exterior viſible Sacrifice, which is commonly called Sacrifice, is a ſigne of the interior, and when it is without this, it is hipocriſye, as a falſe ſigne. So God will prayer, and Sacrifice; and he will not prayer, nor Sacrifice: He will haue pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Sacrifice, when they are conioyned with the prayer, and Sacrifice of the heart: and he will not haue prayer, nor Sacrifice, when they are not accompanied with the heart: becauſe they are hipocriſie, as making ſhew of that, which is not. Wherevpon, after the Prophet in the 50. Pſalme, had ſaid: <hi>A Sacrifice to God is an afflicted ſpirit, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryte and humble heart, ô God, thou will not diſpyſe, &amp;c.</hi> Hee addeth: <hi>Then shalt thou accept Sacrifice of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, oblations and holocauſts, then shall they lay calues vpon thyne Altar.</hi> When with the exterior viſible Sacrifice of the Church, men ſhall offer the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Sacrifice of their hearts, by ſorrow for the negligences of their liues paſt, contrition for their ſinnes, and humiliation before God vnto whom that Sacrifice is offered; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall they offer a true and proper Sacrifice of juſtice, oblations, and holocauſtes acceptable to God, and not otherwiſe: becauſe the outward Sacrifices with out this inward, and inuiſible; is but hipocryſie.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Viſible Sacrifices (ſaith <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> in

So when we offer viſible Sacrifice, without the inuiſible Sacrifice of our hearts, it is hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, or diſſembled ſanctitie, which is double iniquitie: becauſe viſible Sacrifices, were inſtituted vnto this end, that they might be a publicke ſacred viſible ſigne, of the inuiſible ſacrifice of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hearts vnto God, as words were ordeyned, to expreſſe the ſinceritie of mens myndes; and becauſe man ſhould alwaies haue an intention, and be euer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to giue his heart, and ſoule to God, without diſſimulation; therefore, he may neuer offer vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Sacrifice, without the inuiſible Sacrifice of his heart.</p>

Propound therefore, before your eyes, two Sacrifices, that according to the order of Aaron, and this according to the order of Melchiſedech, &amp;c.

                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="6">6. Sixtly: the Prophet ſayeth, <hi>There is offered</hi>

                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p>In the law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> there were many bloudy Sacrifices ordeyned, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 1. 3. and alſo diuers vnbloudy. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 2. 1. and 4. and 5. and 14. <hi>Leu</hi> 5. 11. <note place="margin">Vnbloudy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led gifts.</note>

Where the Prophet accompteth a cleane obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an vnbloudy ſacrifice, and a gift offered to God by Prieſts vpon an Altar, as all one.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>S. Paul</hi> alſo maketh mention of theſe two kinds of ſacrifices, and calleth th'vnbloudy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, gifts offered to God in ſacrifice by Prieſts, ſaying: <hi>Euery high Prieſt, taken from amongst men, is appointed for men, in theſe things which appertayne to God, that he may offer gifts and ſacrifices for ſinne.

Heb.</hi> 8. 3. where diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the two kinds of ſacrifices, which where of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by Prieſts in the Church of God, from the beginning of the world, he calleth the vnblou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſacrifices gifts, and placeth them in the firſt rank, as a more excellent kind of ſacrifice, then hoſts offered with carnall effuſion of bloud.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Moreouer, that cleane and vnbloudy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are called gifts, <hi>S. Hierom.</hi> vpon the 25. chap.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:16848:60"/> of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and 15. and 17. <hi>verſes,</hi> doth witnes, ſaying: that gifts were things of wheate flower, or barley flower, or oyle offered to God in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Wherevpon Theophylact vpon this 8. chap. to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and 3. <hi>verſe</hi> ſayth: <hi>If we would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently examine the difference betweene gift and hoſt, it is this, that an host is offered with bloud and flesh: but gifts conſiſt of fruites, and other ſuch things as are vnbloudy.</hi> With whom agreeth our aduerſarie <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Purchas</hi> a Puritan, in the 6. chap. of his 1. booke of his relations of the religions obſerued in all ages, ſaying: <hi>Of ſacrifices there were from the beginning two kinds, th'one called gifts, or oblation of things without life: th'other victimes, or ſlayne ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of birds and beaſts.</hi> Where it is manifeſt, that gifts offered to God by Prieſts, appointed (as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſaith) for that purpoſe, and vnbloudy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice are all one.</p>

If they were of ſolide things, then the manner was in ſigne of the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſacrifice of the hart, to breake or bruiſe them: if of liquid things, then the manner was alſo in ſigne of contrition, and the inuiſible ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16848:61"/> law. So the vnbloudy ſacrifice, or ſacrifices of gifts were diſtinguiſhed from the generall offerings, gifts, oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and tenths of the peole: firſt, for that the ſacrifice of gifts, or vnbloudy ſacrifices were broken or ſhedd; th'other offered whole: theſe were offered vpon an Altar, by Prieſts appoynted for that purpoſe. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 1. th'other offered at the Altar by any one. <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 24. theſe were publike ſacred viſible ſignes of the inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and ſacrifice of the harts of them, who offered, as is proued heretofore; th'other, priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te dewties, and donations, &amp;c. So that not all manner of gifts or oblations were vnbloudy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, or ſacrifices of gifts: but thoſe which were broken or ſhedd to God vpon an Altar, by a lawfull Prieſt, to ſignifie the inuiſible ſacrifice of our harts.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This diſtinction putt downe of bloudy and vnbloudy ſacrifices, or ſacrifices of gifts; it is eaſy to proue, that our Sauiour at his coming was <note place="margin">Our Sauiour established the ſacrifice of gifts in his Churche.</note> to offer vnbloudy ſacrifice, or gifts, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them in his Churche: for after the coming of the Meſſias, all the bloudy ſacrifices were to ceaſe; as witneſſeth the Prophet Dauid in the 39. <hi>Pſalme:</hi> Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> in his firſt chapter: <hi>S. Paul. Heb.</hi> 10. and the Fathers cited in the laſt chapter to this purpoſe. But our Sauiour was not to take away all kind of particular exterior viſible ſacrifice, as I haue proued in the 8. 9. and 10. chapters of this booke: therefore the vnbloudy
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:16848:61"/> ſacrifice, or ſacrifice of gifts, were to be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the Church of God, in the new law.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Moreouer, the Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> ſpeaking of the ſacrifice, which ſhalbe eſtabliſhed in the new law, ſaith, it ſhalbe <hi>a gift,</hi> and <hi>cleane oblation: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach.</hi> 1. wherevpon <hi>Lactantius</hi> who liued about the yeare 290. in the 25. chapter of his 6. book of diuine inſtitutions, ſayth: <hi>There are two things which ought to be offered vnto God, gifts and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; gifts for euer, ſacrifice for a tyme;</hi> with whom agree the ancient Fathers cited before in the laſt chapter, and many more, who ſhalbe cited here after in the enſuing chapters.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And as for the time, when our Sauiour was <note place="margin">Our Sauiour at his last Supper offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red gifts to God.</note> to offer the ſacrifice of gifts, or vnbloudy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and to eſtabliſh it in his Churche: it muſt needs be then, when he changed the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the old law, and inſtituted the Prieſts of the new, which was at his laſt Supper, as appeareth by <hi>Iudas Iſcariot</hi> who vvas a Prieſt and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, as witneſſeth <hi>S. Peter Act.</hi> 1. 20. And yet could not be made before the laſt Supper; nor yet after, ſeeing that preſently after the laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, hee went forth, and betrayed our Lord: <hi>Luc.</hi> 22. and no man euer made a Prieſt, or Biſhop, but he inſtructed him, what he was to doe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, our aduerſaryes in the book of their conſecration of Prieſts, doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, that the conſecration, and adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the new law, doth belong vnto the office
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:16848:62"/> of the Prieſts, of the new lavv: but at the laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per our Sauiour not only conſecrated, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred the Sacrament of the new law himſelfe, as our aduerſaries confeſſe; but alſo gaue vnto the Apoſtles authoritie to conſecrate, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacrament of the new law, ſaying: <hi>Do this</hi> (the ſame which he then did) <hi>for a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of me;</hi> and therefore he then made them Prieſts, and gaue them authoritie, to offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy Sacrifice, or the ſacrifice of gifts, and eſtabliſhed the ſaid kind of ſacrifice to be vſed in his Church. This ſett downe, lett vs examine what our Lord did at his laſt Supper.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Firſt, he tooke bread, which was a meate or thing vſed in the ſacrifice of gifts, and vnbloudy ſacrifice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 18. Secondly, he bleſſed the bread, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 25. and ſo made it holy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to God, as al things offered in ſacrifices are. Thirdly, he brake it, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 26. with was accuſtomed to be donn, in all ſacrifices of gifts, or vnbloudy ſacrifices, as I haue proued in the 1. paragraphe of this chapter. Fourthly, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ſubſtance of the bread, into his ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall bodie, ſaying of that with was bread, when he tooke it firſt into his hands, <hi>This is my body,</hi> and ſo made a change of the ſubſtance of bread, into the ſubſtance of his bodie, as I ſhall proue more at large here after, to ſhew the power, and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie of God, who can change, and alter things created, at his will, and pleaſure, which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16848:62"/> oſtenſion of the power of God, is vſed in all <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi> as I haue ſhewed in the 2. chapter. And laſtly, he gaue his body for a gift to God for vs; thereby to ſignifie, the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our hearts, and our ſubiection vnto him, and his dominion ouer vs, as is vſed in particular externall viſible <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> ſaying: <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you. Luk.</hi> 22. By which words, it is plaine, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the bodie, which our Sauiour deliuered in the Communion to the Apoſtles, was a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular gift, and vnbloudy <hi>Sacrifice</hi> giuen to God for vs, to ſignifie the ſacrifice of our harts &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. In like manner our Sauiour at his laſt Supper took wyne, which alſo was vſed in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy ſacrifices, or ſacrifice of gifts, as witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Scripture in the ſacrifice of <hi>Melchiſedech, Gen.</hi> 13. and after bleſſed it, as witneſſeth <hi>S. Paul.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. So that it was holy, and conſecrated wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to God, as is the wyne of all ſacrifices; and changed the ſubſtance of that which before vvas wyne, into the ſubſtance of his bloud, ſaying: <hi>This is my bloud. Math.</hi> 26. 28. To ſhew the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power of God who is able to alter, and change all things created at his will and pleaſure; vvhich alteration by ſome change of the thing offered, is vſed in all ſacrifices; and laſtly, to ſhed his bloud to God for vs, therby to ſignifie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible contrition, and ſacrifice of our harts, and his dominion ouer vs, and our ſubiection vnto him, ſaying: <hi>This is my bloud, which is shed for you.</hi>
                        <pb n="224" facs="tcp:16848:63"/> 
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. not after a carnall, or cruell manner; but after the manner of a gift, cleane oblation, and vnbloudy ſacrifice, as witneſſeth the practiſe and experience of all ages; no Chriſtian Catholik man euer affirming, that our Sauiour at his laſt ſupper ſhed his bloud after a carnal cruell manner: but after the manner of gifts, and cleane vnbloudy Sacrifices, to the fulfilling of the Prophecies cited before in the 8. and 10. Chapters.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Our aduerſaries confeſſe that our Lord at his laſt Supper adminiſtred the communion vnto the Apoſtles: and it is neuer read of any ſect, or ſort of people in former ages that they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated together, and not of meate offered in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God, except the Epicures and Atheiſts, as I haue proued in the 6. Chapter of this book. Wherefore ſeeing that our Sauiour at his laſt ſupper adminiſtred the holy communion; it is manifeſt, that he offered firſt ſacrifice in the meate which he deliuered in the communion, before he deliuered it; and bloudy Sacrifices being to ceaſe in the new law, as I haue proued; it neceſſarily followeth that our Sauiour at his laſt ſupper offered vnbloudy Sacrifices of gifts, and adminiſtred the communion of the ſame: and that theſe gifts, or vnbloudy Sacrifices were his body and bloud, vnder the ſpecies of bread and wyne: ſeeing he in plaine and expreſſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes ſayth of them: <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you Luk</hi> 22. <hi>This is my body which is broken for you.</hi>
                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:16848:63"/> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>This is my bloud which is ſhed for you. Luk.</hi> 22.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And after that our Sauiour at his laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per had offered a Sacrifice of gifts, or an vnblou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Sacrifice in his body and bloud, and had communicated the Apoſtles of the ſame, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently by an expreſſe command eſtabliſhed the ſaid kind of Sacrifice in his Church, for a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of him ſaying: <hi>Doe this</hi> (the ſame which he then did) <hi>for a commemoration of mee Luk</hi> 22; <hi>And this doe ye for the commemoration of mee</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24.

For there neither is, nor euer was before the rebellion of Luther, amongſt anie ſect or ſort of Chriſtians (reputed heretickes to both
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16848:64"/> parties only excepted) any book of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the holie communion, but thoſe which teach how to offer vnbloudie Sacrifice, in the body, and bloud of our Lord, and how to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the communion in the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This is firſt manifeſt by the practiſe, and proceeding of our Aduerſaries themſelues; <note place="margin">Protestant Biſhops and Priests, are nevve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions.</note> who vvhen they did reſolue in the 2. yeare of King Edvvard the ſixt a child to forſake the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Religion, and faith in this point, and to haue a Religion vvherein there ſhould be noe offering of vnbloudie Sacrifice, or receauing the bodie and bloud of our Lord from the hand of a Prieſt, or Altar; could not finde before the time of the Rebellion of Luther anie one Biſhop, or Prieſt, who had taken ſuch orders, or was orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Biſhop, or Prieſt of ſuch a Religion (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and reputed hereticks to both parties onely excepted) by whom they could, or might haue ſuch Biſhops and Prieſts made; nor yet anie book in the whole Chriſtian world in the ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Luther, where in they might, or could fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the formes, or manner of making, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating ſuch kind of Biſhops, or Prieſts. But ſeeing they would needs haue ſuch a kinde of Biſhops, and Prieſts, and ſuch a kinde of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they were forced to inuent a new forme and manner of making, and conſecrating Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts, conformable vnto their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyres; as appeareth by their book intituled, <hi>The</hi>

And this their forme and manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe their Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons is ſo diſſonant from all the manners and formes vſed before the rebellion of <hi>Luther,</hi> that in the 36.

                     <p n="5">5. The Apoſtles themſelues beleeuing that our Lord ordained them Biſhops, and Prieſts to offer vnbloudy Sacrifice, or Sacrifice of Giftes in his bodie and bloud, for a commemoration of <note place="margin">The forme of making Bishops, and Prieſts, ſet dvvne by the Apostles</note> him, ſett forth alſo a forme, or manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating other Biſhops and Prieſts, to offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy Sacrifice, or Sacrifice of Giftes in his body and bloud, for a commemoration of him in the 8. booke of their conſtitutions: where in the conſecration of a Biſhop, the Conſecrator ſaith: <hi>Giue vnto him</hi> (that is conſecrated) <hi>ô All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie Lord, by thy Chriſt, the participation of the holie Ghoſt, that he may haue power to remitt ſinnes, according to thy command, and of looſing all bands, according to the power which thou haſt giuen vnto the Apoſtles, and of pleaſing thee in meekenes, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of heart, by offering vnto thee alwaies without fault and without ſinne, a pure and vnbloudie Sacrifice, which by Christ thou hast established the miſterie of the new Teſtament, as a fragrant ſmell of sweetenes.</hi> For as the Apoſtles ſaie in the laſt chapter of their ſaid booke: <hi>The only begotten Chriſt did not</hi>

And we offering a pure and vnbloudie Sacrifice as our Lord ordained, haue choſen Bishops, &amp; Prieſts, and ſeauen Deacons.</hi> Thus the Apoſtles in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions: and for the proofe of their authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calnes, I referr you to the preface of <hi>Franciſcus Turrianus,</hi> ſett before them.

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>REligion</hi> (ſaith S. Thomas in 22. queſt: 81. Art. 1.) <hi>is a vertue by which men giue to God due worshipp and reuerence:</hi> wherin hee agreeth with <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> (in his book of the nature of God) ſaying: <hi>It is the office of religion to giue due honor vnto God.</hi> And the honor and worshipp which is cheef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and moſt properly due vnto God is the inuiſible Sacrifice of the heart, and the outward viſible Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of ſome creature to expreſſe the inuiſible Sacrifice of the ſoule, as wordes doe things, which is properly <hi>Latria</hi> or ſeruice due vnto God, as God and Creator of all things, as I haue shewed more at large in the 5. and 6. Chapters of the firſt part. Whereupon it cometh to paſſe, that without the offering of viſible Sacrifice, there cannot be any perfect <hi>Religion;</hi> for though ſome of the more pious ſort of men, by a longer cuſtome, and much practiſe, may attaine vnto a continuall, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inuiſible Sacrifice of their hearts, by inward ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogicall actes without the helpe of exterior viſible Sacrifice; yet becauſe the myndes of men in this life, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the organs of the bodie for their knowledge
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16848:80"/> and operations, therefore they haue need, to be lead by the hand of ſenſible and viſible things vnto God, and inuiſible: becauſe as <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaith in the first to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the inuiſible things of God are knowne by the viſible, and the increated by the creature, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in this life be well knowne, or learned of man by other meanes. Therefore <hi>Religion</hi> cannot ſtand without viſible Sacrifice, which may as by a ſigne, or motiue, conduct the mindes of men vnto the inuiſible of the heart; ſo to be vnyted vnto God.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the strength of a kingdome is the vnitie, or concord of the ſubiects amongst themſelues, and with their Soueraigne vnder God; and by viſible Sacrifice, not onely a league of freindshippe, and ciuill vnitie is made amongst men, by the participation and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thing, that is ſacrificed, as is proued in the 2. chapter of the firſt part; but alſo there paſſeth, as it were a couenant betwixt God and them, whereby they become his particular people, and he their God, and Protector, without whoſe particular prouidence and protection, no common wealth can either prosper or ſtand. VVhereupon it cometh to paſſe, that there cannot be anie perfect common wealth or well framed monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, without the offering of viſible Sacrifice to God; for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16848:80"/> which cauſe <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the 7. of his politickes, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the things which are preciſely neceſſarie to the preſeruation of a common-wealth (guided by the light of abondant reaſon) giueth order that <hi>Speciall care be had of the Sacrifice to the Gods:</hi> becauſe this is the end and office of viſible Sacrifice, to vnite men with God, and amongst themſelues; as further witneſſeth <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in the 5. Chapter of his 10. booke of the Cittie of God; ſaying: <hi>VVhatſoeuer things we reade, to haue been commanded by God diuers waies, concerning ſacrifices in miſterie of the tabernacle, or of the temple, they are referred vnto the loue of God, and of our neighbour;</hi> by which loue peace, vnitie, and concord, the commonwealth is eſtablished. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing that ſome kinde of exterior viſible Sacrifice, is ſo abſolutely neceſſarie, both to the ſtate of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the perfection of a common wealth, as that they cannot well stand, or be without them, it cannot be that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord, the wiſdome of his eternall Father, should either eſtablish a <hi>Religion,</hi> or plant a common wealth amongst men without the institution of a daily Sacrifice, as I shall shew more at large, in the enſuing chapters.</p>

To effect this his vnion, as ſoon as he had ended the externall viſible <hi>Bloudie Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of the Paſcall Lambe, wherewith the Children of the Church were vnyted, and communicated
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16848:82"/> in the ould law, he prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly inſtituted the exterior, viſible and <hi>vnbloudie Sacrifice,</hi> or Giftes of the new Law in his bodie, and bloud, vnder the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of bread and wyne, that his Church ſhould not no for a little tyme, be without a Law, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and particular exterior <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> or God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Sacrifice the meanes of vnitie.</note> his viſible honor of <hi>Latria,</hi> or diuine worſhip due onely vnto him, or the Children of his Church, without that meanes of vnitie with him and amongſt them ſelues, which he deſired.

                     <p n="5">5.

                     <p n="6">6. It is to be noted, that the bloud, which was here ſhed, was in a Chalice, according to his words,

                     <head>CHAP. II. How theſe wordes, this is my body which shalbe deliuered for you, import alſo a Sacrifice in his bodie.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. IF we read this Text of <hi>S. Paule,</hi> according to the vulgar latin tranſlation, which ſaith: <hi>This is my bodie which shalbe deliuered for you.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24. it agreeth in one, with that of <hi>S. Luke,</hi> which ſaith: <hi>This is my bodie which is giuen for you:</hi> and with that of the greeke tranſlation, which ſaith: <hi>This is my body which is broken for you;</hi> when the Scriptures ſaie; <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you;</hi> or, <hi>This is my body which is broken for you,</hi> in the preſent tenſe, they intend, that it is then giuen vnto God for vs, after the manner of Gifts, and vnbloudy <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> and where the Scriptures ſaie: <hi>This is my body which shalbe deliuered for you;</hi> or, <hi>This is my bloud which shalbe shed for you;</hi> in the future tenſe; they intend, that it ſhalbe ſhed for vs, after the manner of vnbloudy <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> in the Church, vntil the end of the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For proof wherof as I haue ſaid before, it is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16848:87"/> firſt to be noted, that here in the words of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and adminiſtration of the bleſſed Sacrament, <note place="margin">Our Sauiour ſpeaketh of the actions of his Church and not of the Ievves.</note> our Sauiour ſpeaketh of his owne actions, and the actions of thoſe, who were to make a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of him, and not of the actions of the Iewes, and therefore ſaith: <hi>This is my body which shalbe deliuered for you,</hi> in commemoration of me. So that when the Apoſtles were to make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of our Sauiour (as they did for the moſt part euery day, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.) they were to deliuer that ſame body to God for vs, and to offer <hi>Sacrifice</hi> with that body, and not with anie other; and therefore preſently after theſe wordes; <hi>This is my body which shalbe deliuered for you</hi> (to God) he addeth; <hi>Do this in commemoration of me;</hi> to ſignify, that the ſame body which he then deliuered, ſhould be deliuered alſo to God for vs, in his Church, vntill he come againe. And this is manifeſt by the text it ſelfe: for <hi>S. Paule,</hi> who ſetteth it downe, relateth what <note place="margin">S. Paule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth vvhat our Sauiour did, and not vvhat the Ievves vvere to doe.</note> our Sauiour did at his laſt Supper, and not what the Iewes were to doe, againſt him in his Paſſion; ſaying: <hi>Our Lord Ieſus, in the night he was betrayed, tooke bread, and giuing thankes, brake, and ſaid: Take ye and eate, this is my body, which shalbe deliuered for you,</hi> in the commemoration of me.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Secondly, at his Paſſion, and in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> vpon the Croſſe, his body was not deliuered by himſelfe, to be crucified, but by <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the <note place="margin">The Ievves deliuered our Sauiour to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> Iewes, <hi>Iudas</hi> ſaying: <hi>What will you giue me, and I will deliuer him vnto you: Matth.</hi> 26. 15. <hi>And the chiefe</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:16848:88"/> 
                        <hi>Priests, and ancients of the People, brought him bound, and deliuered him vnto Ponce Pilate, Matth.</hi> 27. 1. and <hi>Pilate hauing ſcourged Ieſus, deliuered him vnto them, for to be crucified: Matth.</hi> 27. 26. So here he could not ſpeake of the deliuering of his body to be crucified: for then (when he ſaith: <hi>Doe this in commemoration of me)</hi> he ſhould command them, to deliuer his body to the Iewes, or deſyre to be crucified againe: which is abſurd: but hee ſaith: <hi>This is my body which shalbe deliuered for you,</hi> to God in his Church, <hi>for a commemoration of me:</hi> which accordingly, whe fynd true by experience: for the ſame ſubſtantiall body which he deliuered then, according to the Catholique faith, hath bin euer ſince, and is at this tyme deliuered for vs in commemoration of him, all ouer the world, to the fulfilling of theſe his words: <hi>This is my body which shalbe deliuered for you,</hi> and of the Profecies, and Promiſſes, and alſo of this his command, <hi>Doe this in commemoration of me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Thirdly, if our Sauiour, had not intended a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in his laſt Supper, and that his true, reall, and ſubſtantiall body, ſhould not be in it; he would not haue ſpoken theſe words: <hi>This is my body which shalbe deliuered for you:</hi> but haue left them out, and haue ſaid, <hi>take ye and eate this bread in commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me,</hi> and ſo it had bin a cleare caſe, that he had neither offered <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> nor giuen his body in the communion. But he being God, and truth it ſelfe, and ſent into the world to teath vs the truth,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16848:88"/> and he ſaying in the communion: <hi>This is my body which shalbe deliuered for you, this doe ye for a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of me:</hi> no indifferent man can deny, but that our Sauiour commanded vs to giue, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his body to God for vs, in the commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we were to make of him, or that <hi>S. Paule,</hi> and the Apoſtles offered not <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in the body of our Lord, and alſo taught the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to offer <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in the body of our Lord; ſeeing he ſaith, that he deliuered vnto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that manner of adminiſtrating of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which he receaued from our Lord. And in like manner; though the Greekes, for the moſt part ſay of the Chalice, <hi>which is shed for you,</hi> and the Latins, for the moſt part ſay, <hi>which shalbe shed for you,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 20. yet they both in effect ſaye one thing, and importe a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in the bloud of our Lord: the greekes intending by theſe wordes, that <note place="margin">Hovv is shed and shalbe shed, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curr in one.</note> the bloud of our Lord is ſhed for vs vnto God, at that preſent time; and the Latins, that it ſhalbe ſhed to God for vs in his Church, vntill the end of the world.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Fourthly, our Aduerſaries cannot deny; but that our Sauiour in theſe wordes, taught <hi>S. Paule</hi> to conſecrate, and adminiſter the holie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and <hi>S. Paule</hi> the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and did not teach what the Iewes did, or were to doe, when they were to crucify our Lord; the text is ſo plaine: So that theſe wordes: <hi>This is my body which shalbe deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for you;</hi> or <hi>bloud which shalbe shed for you;</hi> haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16848:89" rendition="simple:additions"/> vnto the conſecration, and adminiſtration of the communion, and not vnto the Paſſion of our Sauiour vpon the Croſſe, inflicted vpon him by the Iewes. Whereby it is moſt manifeſt, that here our Sauiour ſaith; <hi>This is my body which shalbe delibered for you,</hi> and <hi>bloud which shalbe shed for you,</hi> when you conſecrat the communion, make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of me, or celebtate the memorie of the laſt Supper; and ſo giueth Biſhopps and Prieſts and expreſſe command, not to adminiſter the holie communion, without offering <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in his body and bloud to God for vs; which according <note place="margin">Chriſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured his body for vs: and offered his body in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for vs all one.</note> to the phraſe of Scripture, is all one with offering <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> the Scriptures ſaying: <hi>Christ was deliuered vp for our ſinnes.

                     <p n="6">6. Fiftly, that here our Sauiour doth not ſpeake of his body, and bloud, as it was to be deliuered, or ſhed vpon the Croſſe for our Redemption, is manifeſt, for that, there vpon the Croſſe, his body <note place="margin">Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s' bloud shed vpon the Croſſe for all; at his laste ſupper for manie.</note> was deliuered, and his bloud was ſhed for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd, as <hi>S.

                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:16848:89"/> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. as he deliuered his body, and bloud vpon the Croſſe, <hi>he is Sauiour of the world, Ioh.</hi> 4. 14. whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beleeuing <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſaid: <hi>We beleeue, and doe know that this is the Sauiour of the world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Ioh.</hi> 4. 41. But at his laſt Supper, to ſhew that he doth not ſpeake of the giuing, or deliuering of his body vpon the Croſſe, or the ſhedding of his bloud vpon the Croſſe, he doth not ſay: <hi>This is my body which shalbe deliuered for all:</hi> but, <hi>this is my hody which shalbe deliuered for you,</hi> who are of my Church, for to the Apoſtles he ſpoke it. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>This is my bloud of the new Testament, that shalbe shed for manie vnto remiſsion of ſinnes, Matth.</hi> 26. 28. And againe, <hi>This is my bloud of the new Teſtament, that shalbe shed for manie. Mark</hi> 14. 14. Whereby it is manifeſte vnto anie indifferent Reader, that here, at his laſte Supper, our Sauiour doth not ſpeake of the deliuering of his body, or ſhedding of his bloud, at it was vpon the Croſſe, but at it is in the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> or <hi>Maſſe,</hi> ſeeing he limiteth this deliuering of his body vnto the Apoſtles, and this ſhedding of his bloud vnto manie, and not vnto all.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Our Sauiour here made, and eſtabliſhed the new Teſtament in his bloud, ſaying of his bloud: <note place="margin">Our Lord at his laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, made his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>

Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdome is the ſpirituall Kingdome of Chriſts Church militant here vpon earth: of which it is ſaid: <hi>The ſonne of man shall ſend his Angells, and they shall gather out of his Kingdome all ſcandalls, and them that vvorke iniquitie. Math.</hi> 13. 41. And both theſe Kingdomes, and all that is wrought in them, were miraculouſly at the firſt founded, and eſtabliſhed by the omnipotency of the will, and <note place="margin">Both Gods Kingdomes, are miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> word of God: according to the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſaying: <hi>God ſpoke, and they were made. Pſal.</hi> 32. 9. and this firſt foundation of theſe Kingdomes, and eſtabliſhing them in their operations, was miraculous, becauſe they were not before: but being thus founded, and eſtabliſhed, now their ordinary operations, are not miraculous: becauſe God hath giuen vnto either of them, their ſeuerall
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16848:129"/> ordinary natures, diſpoſitions, properties, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litis, which they are ordinarily to reteyne, and keepe, vnto the end of the world: God hauing ſo ordeined, and decreed by the omnipotency of his will, and woord.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the better vnderſtanding hereof it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obſerue, that mirakles, as <hi>S.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16848:129"/> confeſſion, or by reading the words of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ouer the bread, and wine fittly prepared, ſhould truely, and really forgiue ſinnes, or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the body, and bloud of our Lord: this I ſaye were a miracle: becauſe theſe things are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinarily, nor vſually donne by laye men of Gods temporall Kingdome: nor can be donne, vnles God contrary to the ordinary courſe of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution from ſinnes, and conſecration, doe ſupply the defects: yet thoſe (the inſtitution, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God ſuppoſed) are no mirakles, when they are donn in the Church of God by Prieſts, who are inſtituted by God for that purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are commonly, and vſually donne by them: ſo likewiſe if a Prieſt by doing any act, which preciſly belongeth vnto the ſpirituall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſts Church herevpon earth, ſhould bring forth a tree, or plant; this were a mirakle: becauſe that by the exercice of Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, trees, or plants, are not ordinarily, or vſually brought forth: yet that the earth bringeth forth trees, and plants, is no miracle; becauſe the earth vſually, and commonly doth it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16848:130"/> Kingdome, of the Church of Chriſt, here vpon earth; ſupernaturall, and miraculous, and aboue the reach of humane ſenſe, and naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: as that God ſhould haue a Sonne, a Virgin ſhold remaine a Virgin, and yet bring forth a Child; God to die vpon a Croſſe, men to be borne againe by Baptiſme, and cleanſed from their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the body of the Sonne of God, to be in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament of the Altar &amp;c. wherevpon <hi>S.

Wherefore, ſeing that all the workes of God, in the foundation of his ſpirituall Kingdome, which is the Church of Chriſt herevpon earth, are miraculous, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, and aboue the reach of common ſenſe, and naturall reaſon: it muſt needs be, that alſo the <note place="margin">The institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the communion, miraculous.</note> inſtitution of the communion, which is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and worke of God in the foundation of his Church, muſt alſo be a worke of ſupernatural pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er, and vertue, aboue the reach of humane ſenſe, and naturall reaſon: and therefore, it ſhould be a vaine thing; to goe about, to giue a reaſon in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how our Lord did, or doth conſecrate his reall, and ſubſtantiall body, and bloud in the bleſſed Sacrament, but only by ſimilitude, in the foundation, conſeruation, and preſeruation of his temporall Kingdome: ſo by the way of ſimilitude, from that which our Aduerſaries doe belieue, to bring them vnto that, which they belieue not, that they may ſaue their ſoules.</p>

                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:16848:130"/> 4. This obſerued, we doe not alwayes flie vnto miracles, in euery particuler act, or ſpirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe <note place="margin">The actes of Christian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, novv not miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</note> of our religion; as when euery child is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, or when euery Prieſt doth conſecrate: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God by the omnipotency of his will, and woord hath eſtabliſhed his ſpirituall Kingdome, of his Chriſtian Church after this manner: ſo that now this ſuppoſed, her ordinary actions, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are not miraculous: but according to the common, and vſuall courſe of the acts, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which God hath eſtabliſhed, in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Kingdome of his Church, and according to that ſpirituall nature, which God hath giuen vnto her, at her firſt foundation. So that, whereas before Baptiſme was inſtituted by our Lord, if any one ſhould haue pronounced the words of Baptiſme, and haue powred water vpon a man, who neuer was baptized, it would haue had no power, or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to remit ſinnes, or to make him a child of the ſpirituall Kingdome of God; and ſo the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was miraculous: becauſe the water, and the words had not this power before: but now, ſince that God Almightie, by the omnipotency of his power, hath inſtituted Baptiſme, and eſtabliſhed it in his Church, and giuen vnto it, this ſpirituall vertue, and power to clenſe men of their ſinnes, make them Children of this ſpirituall Kingdome which is his Church, and Heires which Chriſt of eternall life; now this is no miracle: but it is the ſpirituall nature, and propertie of Baptiſme, which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16848:131"/> God who hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature, and properties vnto all things, which they haue, hath giuen alſo vnto it: and therefore, now this being ſuppoſed, it is no miracle, that when a man is baptized, his ſinnes are forgiuen: but it ſhould be a miracle, that a man ſhould now be baptized, according to the rights of Baptiſme, and his ſinnes ſhould not be forgiuen: becauſe God hauing once giuen this ſpirituall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue vnto Baptiſme, and hauing made it, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, propertie, and qualitie of Baptiſme, cannot take it away, without altering the courſe of the nature, propertie, and qualitie of Baptiſme, which is a miracle.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Lykwiſe when our Lord inſtituted the B. Sacrament, he took bread, bleſſed, gaue thanks, and ſaid: <hi>This is my body,</hi> and by vertue of his omnipotency, conſecrated it, or made it his true, reall, and ſubſtantiall body; and when he had donn, ſaid vnto Biſhopps, and Prieſts rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned: <note place="margin">It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of Priests rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned, to conſecrate the body, and bloud of our Lord.</note> 
                        <hi>Do this</hi> (the ſame that he then did) <hi>for a commemoration of me,</hi> and by vertue of his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, they do the ſame, that he then did. The firſt inſtitution was ſupernaturall, and miraculous: but afterwards, Biſhopps, and Prieſts, did, and do conſecrate the ſame body, and bloud which our Lord then did, without any new miracle: becauſe he who created all things of nothing, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto euery thing, that nature, propertie, and qualitie which it hath, hath alſo giuen Biſhopps, and Prieſts rightly ordeyned this propertie, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16848:131"/> qualitie. So now it is not a miracle, that Prieſts do conſecrat the true, reall, and ſubſtantiall body, and bloud of our Lord; but it ſhould be a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, if now that the Euchariſt is eſtabliſhed, they do that which our Lord then commaunded them to doe, and yet ſhould not conſecrat his true, reall, and ſubſtantiall body, and bloud: becauſe that then, our Lord ſhould ſuſpend or alter the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and qualities, which he hath giuen to Biſhopps, and Prieſts, which would be a miracle.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In like manner in other things: <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God created heauen and earth, and the earth was void, and vacant. Gen.</hi> 1. 2. and neither brought forth hearbs, nor trees, nor graſse, nor plants, nor euer would haue donn, if God had then lett it alone, and neither haue ſaid, nor donn, any more vnto it: but afterwards God ſaid: <hi>Lett the earth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it vvas mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, that the earth should bring forth hearbs plants, and trees.</note> 
                        <hi>shoot forth green hearbs, and ſuch as may ſeed, and fruit trees, yeilding fruit, after his kind, ſuch as may haue ſeed in it ſelf vpon earth: and it was ſo donn. Gen.</hi> 1. 11. this was a ſupernaturall, and miraculous work of God: but euer ſince, it hat been naturall vnto the earth, to bring forth hearbes, and fruit trees, without any new miracle: becauſe God, who is the giuer of all the properties, and qualities, which things haue, gaue alſo vnto the earth this, to bring <note place="margin">Novv it is proper to the earth to bring forth hearbs, and trees.</note> forth hearbes, and fruit trees. And it ſhould be a miracle, if the earth ſhould not do it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And the like we may ſay of the hauing of Children, and creation of ſoules: <hi>God created man,</hi>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:16848:132"/> 
                        <hi>to his own image, to the image of God he created him, male and female he created them. Gen.</hi> 1. 27. that is, he created their ſoules: for <hi>Adam</hi> he formed of the ſlyme of the earth, and <hi>Eue</hi> of a rib taken out of <hi>Adams</hi> ſide, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. And vpon their firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they had no children, nor could haue, or begett any vntill God, ſaid: <hi>Increaſe, and multiply, and replenish the earth. Gen.</hi> 1. 28. And this firſt was a miracle, that God ſhould giue that power vnto men, and woemen, to be his inſtruments, of bringing forth ſoules into the world: but now that the generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men is eſtabliſhed, it is no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, but agreeable to the vſuall courſe of nature, that God in the generation of men, doth creat ſoules: but if nature concurring, men, and woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould bring forth bodies without ſoules, it would be a miracle: becauſe God ſhould ſuſpend, or alter the courſe of nature, which he hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the creation of ſoules in the generation of men.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. So as men and woemen, God, and nature concurring, bring forth ſoules into the world vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this daye, and ſhall doe vntil the end by vertue of theſe words once ſpoken, ſaying: <hi>Increaſe, and multiply. Gen.</hi> 1. 28. So Biſhopps, and Prieſts rightly ordained, in bread and wine fittly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, haue hitherto, and ſhal vntil the end of the world, conſecrate the true, reall, and ſubſtantiall body, and bloud of the Sonne of God, by vertue of theſe words, once ſaid: <hi>Doe this</hi> (the ſame that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16848:132"/> he then did) <hi>in commemoration of me.</hi> And in due conſideration, it ſeemeth as hard a thing, that men, and woemen, ſhould be God Almigties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, to bring forth ſo many millions of ſoules into the world, which before were not: as for Biſhopps, and Prieſts to be his agents, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of making one body, that was before, to be in diuers places, and vnder diuers demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. If our Puritans beleeue, that by vertue of theſe words, <hi>Increaſe and multiply,</hi> once ſpoken, Almigtie God doth ſo concourr in the generation of men, as that they haue ſoules: I ſee noe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, why they ſhould not beleeue, that Biſhopps and Prieſts rightly ordayned, by vertue of theſe words, once ſaid: <hi>Doe this</hi> (the ſame which he then did) ſhould not haue power, and authority as <note place="margin">The cauſe vvhy Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans, and Puritans deny the reall preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in the B. Sacrament.</note> agents, and inſtruments of God, to conſecrate his true, reall, and ſubſtantiall body, and bloud: if it be not, but becauſe they want the Sacrament of order, and know that theſe words, <hi>Do this,</hi> were not ſpoken vnto them. And therefore knowing that they haue no authority, or power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrat, and yet reſolue to be as they are; not to fall into manifeſt idolatry, and to teach the people, to eſteeme, and adore a peece of bread for God; of two euils, haue choſen the leſſer; and therefore ſay that after conſecration, there is nothing but bread, and wine, our Sauiours words effect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the whole buſines co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in taking bread,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16848:133"/> and apprehending Chriſt in heauen, by the hand of faith, and be thankefull. Otherwiſe if we ſhould ſeeke to pry, and dyue into, by naturall reaſon, how, and when, and after what manner, God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſoules in the generation of men, and infuſeth them into their bodyes; or of what ſubſtance they are of, or how they being ſpirituall, informe the body and make one man with the body, what operations they haue, where the <hi>will, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> and <hi>memory</hi> are placed, and how they are diuided, ſeeing the ſoule hath no parts, how the ſoule mooueth the body, and preſerueth it from corruption, how it affordeth ability te <hi>ſee, heare, ſmell, touch,</hi> and <hi>tast;</hi> in what gulf the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory putteth all theſe ſpecies of things, which ſhe reteyneth, from whence they come, when they are called for, and where ſome lye hid, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found, when we would, and how, and where we find then; we ſhall find no leſſe difficulty in theſe things, then in knowing how a body, that already is, may at the ſame tyme be in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and vnder diuers dimenſions, and ſpecies by the will, and power of God.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. And if none ſhould beleeue, that he had a ſoule vnleſſe he did know certainly, and manifeſtly all theſe, <hi>howes;</hi> then few would attaine vnto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, that he had a ſoule, thoug all men ſhould ſtudy <hi>Aristotles</hi> book <hi>de anima,</hi> or what ſoeuer books they could find to that purpoſe all their liues yet what is more familiar vnto a man, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſoule,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16848:133"/> wherewith he liues, and mooues: whereby we ſee, ho abſurd a thing it is, not to beleeue the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our faith, vnleſſe we cann certainly, and manifeſtly know by reaſon, how euery thing in particular is: for then it were not a miſtery of faith, but a thing manifeſt to our ſenſes: whereas faith, <hi>Is an argument of things not appearing</hi> (to the ſenſes) <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Wherefore as in the creation of all <note place="margin">As in the founding of his earthly Kingdome God ſpake, and things vvere ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: ſo in founding his ſpirituall Kingdome, vvhich is his Church.</note> things, and eſtabliſhing his earthly Kingdome, God ſpake the word, and we beleeue that they were made of nothing, by the omnipotency of his word, though we know not how God made them, or could make them of nothing, more then by the omnipotency of his word: ſo here eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the B. Sacrament in his Church, he took bread, and bleſſed, and ſaid: <hi>This is my body,</hi> and likwiſe wine, and ſaid: <hi>This is my bloud,</hi> and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that the bread was changed into his body, and the wine into his bloud, by the omnipotency of his word, though we know not how God could change bread into his body, or vvine into his bloud, and putt them into ſo little a roome, and vnder the ſpecies of bread, and vvine, but by the omnipotency of his vvord. And as after, God had created the earth, and mankind, he ſaid to the earth: <hi>Let the earth shoote forth green hearbs, and ſuch as may ſeed, &amp;c.</hi> and to man: <hi>Increaſe, and multiply,</hi> and vve beleeue, that both the earth, and man by the omnipotency of his vvord, receaued vertue, and power to do that vvhich he ſaid, though we do
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16848:134"/> not know, vvhere this power lyeth, or in vvhat part, or hovv theſe things come to paſse, more then by the omnipotency of his vvord: ſo after that God had inſtituted this Sacrament, and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his body, and bloud, he ſaid to Biſhopps, and Prieſts rightly ordained: <hi>Doe this,</hi> and <hi>This doe ye,</hi> and vve beleeue that Biſhopps and Prieſts rightly ordained, haue power to conſecrate the body, and bloud of our Lord, though vve doe not knovv, vvhere the power lyeth in Prieſts, or hovv it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe more then by the omnipotency of the vvord of God.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Beſides that vvhich I haue ſaid in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, <hi>S. Iohn Damaſcene</hi> in the 14. chapter of his 4. book <hi>Orthodoxaefidei,</hi> explicateth this point at large, ſaying: <hi>Our Lord breaking the bread, gaue it vnto his Diſciples, ſaying: take, eate this is my body &amp;c.</hi>

He ſaid in the beginning, lett the earth bring forth green hearbes, and euen vntill this day, by the fall of raine, the earth doth bring forth her proper plantes, aided, and fortified by the commaundement of God. And God hath ſaid, This is my body: doe this in commemoration of me: and this by the omnipotency of his commaund, will be donn vntill he come.</hi> Thus <hi>S. Damaſcenus,</hi> of the change of the bread and vvine, in the conſecration of the bleſſed Sacrament, by the omnipotency of God. <hi>Euſebius Emiſſenus</hi> in his Sermon of the body of our Lord, ſpeaketh to the ſame effect, ſaying: <hi>When the creatures of bread, and wine, are placed vpon the Altar to be bleſſed, before they are conſecrated by the inuocation of the holy Ghoſt, there is preſent the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bread, and wine; but after the words of Chriſt, there is Chriſts body and bloud; and what great matter is it, if he who could create all things by his word, could conuert, and change theſe thinges, which he had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, into other natures.</hi>

Auguſtine</hi> in his 3. epiſtle to <hi>Veloſianus</hi> ſaith, in the vvonderfull vvorkes of God, and high miſteries of our faith: <hi>All the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the deed, is the omnipotency of the doeer.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>S. Chriſoſtome</hi> in his 83. Homily vpon <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> exhorteth all Chriſtians, ſaying: <hi>Lett vs beleeue wholy in God, and lett vs not contradict him, although that which he ſaith, ſeeme contrary to our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and our ſight. Lett his word haue more authority with vs, then our reaſon, or our eyes &amp;c. Lett vs not behold only the obiects which are there propoſed</hi> (in the bleſſed Sacrament) <hi>but lett vs imbrace his words, for his words cannot abuſe vs; but our ſenſe is eaſily decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. His word hath neuer failed; but our ſenſe is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:16848:135"/> 
                        <hi>euery hower. Wherefore ſeeing that the word itſelfe ſaith: This is my body; let vs be perſuaded, and beleeue it, and we shall ſee it with the eyes of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi> Thus <hi>S. Chriſoſtome;</hi> vvith vvhom agreeth <hi>Gaudentius</hi> in his 2. Tract of the reaſon of the Sacraments, ſaying: <hi>When our Lord gaue the conſecrated bread, and wine vnto his Diſciples, he ſaid vnto them: This is my body. Lett vs beleeue him I praie you, whom we haue beleeued; Truth doth not know what it is to lye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. Wonderfull are the vvorkes of God in his earthly kingdome of this vvorld; yet ſeeing that our Lord deſcended from heauen, and vvas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, to erect a ſpirituall kingdome, farr more excellent, then is this materiall kingdome of the earth, euen ſo excellent, as that he ſaith: <hi>I will dwell, and walke in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16.

Auguſtine,</hi> in the 1. chapter of his 3. book, <hi>de conſenſu Euangeliſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> where after that he hath cited, the words of our Lord, at his laſt Supper, as they are ſet down by the reſt of the Euangeliſts, ſaith: <hi>That S.

Iohn,</hi> for no where elſe hath he ſpoken of the Communion. Againe in the laſt chapter of his 4. book, he ſaith that <hi>S.

                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:16848:137"/> 
                        <hi>flesh, &amp;c.</hi> So that it cannot with any reaſon be denyed, that <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> in his 6. chapter ſpeaketh of of the bleſſed Sacrament.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Moreouer, this is the condition, and nature of God Almighty, that he neuer giueth, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth <note place="margin">The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, is to giue more, then he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> leſſe then in cleare, and manifeſt words he promiſeth: but for the moſt part, more then he promiſeth, as becometh the liberalitie, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of his infinit mercies: for he that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth more then he promiſeth, doth not deceaue, but he who giueth leſſe, is a deceauer, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor. So it is blaſphemie, to affirme, that Chriſt who is true God, ſhould giue leſſe, then he promiſed in ſo manifeſt, and plaine termes, and theſe ſo often repeated. Wherefore, ſeing that he often promiſed with cleare, and manifeſt words in the 6. of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> that he would giue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bread, bread that came down from heauen, bread which is his fleſh, for the lyfe of the world; meate which is his fleſh, and drinke which is his bloud; meate which who ſoeuer eateth worthily, hath lyfe euerlaſting, and abideth in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him; it cannot without blaſphemy be affirmed, that Chriſt hath not truely, and really performed thoſe things, which he hath ſo often, and ſo plainly, and clearly promiſed, and that rather more then leſſe, then his words import; which cannot be, vnleſſe he giue his true, reall, and ſubſtantiall body, and bloud, himſelf vnder the ſpecies of bread, and wine vnto vs for meate:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16848:137"/> for whatſoeuer inferior thing, he ſhould giue, which ſhould be leſſe then himſelf, the ſame ſhould alſo be leſſe then his promiſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And the want of performance (if any ſuch thing could poſſibly be) were ſo much the more <note place="margin">Our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his flesh.</note> remarkable; for that our Sauiour, with a double aſſurance, or as it were with a kind of oath, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, ſaying: <hi>Amen, Amen, I ſay to you; vnleſſe ye eate the flesh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloud, ye shall not haue lyfe in you.

Iohn,</hi> ſayth: <hi>Truth ſayth, Amen, Amen, I ſay vnto you; what a thing is this, that our Lord shoul, ſaye: Amen, Amen, I ſay vnto you? He commendeth it very much, which he ſo pronounceth; ſeing that if it be lawfull ſo to ſaye: Amen, Amen, I ſaye vnto you, is his oath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Wherefore, ſeeing that it is impoſſible for God to lye and alter all theſe his afore ſayd properties, and conditions, it neceſſarily followeth, that our Lord at the inſtitution of the communion, gaue his true, reall, and ſubſtantiall body, and bloud vnto the Apoſtles in the communion: and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that his true, reall, and ſubſtantiall body, and bloud ſhould be adminiſtred in the communion, to the fulfilling of thoſe his wordes here ſpoken in the 6. <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and alſo at the inſtitution of this Sacrament: where he doth not only ſaye: <hi>This is my body, and this is my bloud;</hi> but, <hi>This is my body, which is giuen for you:</hi> and, <hi>This is my body, which shalbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered for you: This is my bloud, which is shed for many:</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. If after all theſe faire wordes, and large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, of receauing from our Sauiour, this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <note place="margin">God cannot faile to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his many and ſerious promiſes.</note> food, and diuine meate, we ſhould receaue from him, only a peece of bakers bread, and ſupp of vintners wine, which notwithſtanding all that it hath from him, or on his part, is euen after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, but a peece of bread, and ſupp of vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners wine, without any reall qualitie, entitie, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, fleſh, body, or bloud of his in it, more then is in other bakers bread, and vintners wine (which is the aſſertion of our Aduerſaries) who could with reaſon thinke, or beleeue that Chriſt were God, faithfull in his words, and iuſt in all his promiſes?</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That the Puritans ſaye, they receaue the true, reall, and ſubſtantiall body, and bloud of <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans, and Puritans communion, a meere imagination or fiction.</note> our Lord by faith, eate his fleſh and bloud by faith, imagine him there, though he be as farr of in deed, and truth, as it is to heauen; thats no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. For firſt, theſe are their own words, which are no where to be found in the Scriptures. Secondly, we do not looke for the actions of men, what they do, or ought to doe, when they communicate or receaue: but for the actions of God in preparing, and giuing the thing they are to receaue, before they receaue it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, faith or imagination can not make a thing really abſent, to be really preſent, as is manifeſt by experience, and to beleeue that a thing which is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16848:138"/> indeede abſent, is really and indeed preſent; is but a deceipt in the imagination, and a falſe faith, which cann neuer make that which is not preſent, to be preſent. Fourthly, ſuppoſe that theſe ſayings of the Puritans, were true; then the words, and promiſes of Chriſt were falſe, and ſo he ſhould not be true God; for theſe are not his words, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, workes, and actions, but theirs: wherefore if they ſaye true, then our Lord hath not fulfilled his promiſes, and ſo was not true God, not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all his words. But ſeeing that he was true God, and Sonne of God, and truth it ſelfe, it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily followeth that he fulfilled theſe his promiſes ſo ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nely made, and gaue his true, and reall fleſh to eate, and bloud to drinke in the Communion.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And this was as I haue ſaid heretofore the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <note place="margin">Christ vvas God, becauſe he could cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge bread into his body</note> of <hi>S. Irenaeus,</hi> to proue againſt ſome here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks (who denied Chriſt to be God) the changing of bread into his body, and wine into his bloud, ſaying in the 34. chap. of his 4. book of hereſies: <hi>How vvill it be manifeſt to theſe</hi> (heretikes who deny Chriſt to be the Sonne of God) <hi>that the bread vpon vvhich thankes is giuen, is the body of their Lord, and the chalice his bloud; if they do not ſaye, Chriſt to be the ſonne of the biulder of the world, that is to ſay, his vvord, by vvhich trees be are fruite, fountaines flow, the earth first doth giue the blade, afterwards the eare, then full vvheate in the eare.</hi> Thus <hi>S. Irenaeus,</hi> who liued why leſt yet ſome of the Apoſtles ſchollers were liuing, and the actions of our Sauiour, and the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16848:139"/> Apoſtles were freſh in the memory of men. And from hence it is, that euen in the primitiue Church, none denyed, that Chriſt gaue his true, fleſh, and bloud in the Communion, but thoſe who denied him to be God; as witneſſeth <hi>S. Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in his 8. book of the Trinitie, ſaying: <hi>Chriſt ſaid, my flesh is meat indeed, and my bloud is drinke indeed, he that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, remaineth in me, and I in him. There is no place left to doubt of the truth of the flesh, and bloud</hi> (of our Lord in this Sacrament) <hi>for now by the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Lord himſelfe, and by our faith</hi> (or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our faith) <hi>it is truly bloud, and theſe things being taken</hi> (into our handes, as was the cuſtome of the primitiue Church) <hi>and swallowed downe do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke this, that vve may be in Chriſt, and Chriſt in vs. And is not this truth? It falleth out verily that it is not eſteemed true by thoſe, who deny, Chriſt to be God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. From hence it is, that when our Lord firſt preached of this bleſſed Sacrament, in the 6. of <note place="margin">S. Peter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued the reall preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, before he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it.</note> 
                        <hi>S. Iohn, S. Peter</hi> (as witneſſeth <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> vpon the 54. Pſalme) <hi>did not then vnderſtand</hi> (how our Lord would giue vs his fleſh to eate, and his bloud to drinke) <hi>but he beleeued the words to be good, which he did not vnderſtand,</hi> and that they ſhould eate his true fleſh, and drinke his true bloud: becauſe Chriſt was God, and Sonne of God: and therefore caſting of all doubts, and misbeleef againſt this Sacrament, and firmely beleeuing, that they ſhould eate his true flesh indeed, and drinke his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16848:139"/> bloud indeed; anſwered: <hi>Lord vnto whome shall we goe, thou hast the words of eternall lyfe; and we beleeue, and haue known, that thou art Chriſt the ſome of God. Ioh.</hi> 6. 68.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The reaſon why <hi>S. Peter</hi> anſwered thus, was; becauſe the Jewes, and many of the Diſciples, <note place="margin">The reaſon of S. Peters anſvver to our Sauiour, vvhenothers beleeued not his vvords ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> who murmured at our Sauiours words (and ſayed: <hi>This ſaying is hard,</hi> that they ſhould eate his fleſh, and drinke his bloud) did not beleeue, that he was God, but only man, ſaying: <hi>How cann this man giue vs his flesh to eate?</hi> who if they had beleeued, that he was God, and Sonne of God, would haue made no difficulty, in beleeuing that he would giue them his fleſh to eate, and his bloud to drinke; knowing that with God, all things are poſſible. <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 26. and that <hi>there shall not be impoſsible with God any word. Luk.</hi> 1. 37. And therefore <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſaid: <hi>Thou haſt the words of eternall life, and we beleeue, and haue known, that thou art Christ the Sonne of God.</hi> According to the profeſſion of his faith formely made, ſaying: <hi>Thou art Christ the Sonne of God. Math.</hi> 16. 16. And therefore he, and the reſt of the Apoſtles (only <hi>Iudas</hi> excepted) beleeued, that he both could, and would giue <note place="margin">The inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Scriptures, least there might be any doubt.</note> them his fleſh to eate, and bloud to drinke.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And leaſt there might be any doubt made, whether our Sauiour gaue his body, and bloud in the Communion, or no; <hi>S. Matthew, S. Luke, S. Marke,</hi> and <hi>S. Paule,</hi> when they ſpeake of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the communion, doe all affirme, that our
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16848:140"/> Lord took bread, and bleſſing, ſaid: <hi>Take ye, and eate, this is my body;</hi> and likewiſe the Chalice, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Drinke ye all of his, for this is my bloud.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as amongſt them all, accounting both the body, and bloud (leaſt there might be any doubt made of the deliuering his body to eate, and his bloud to drinke) they repeate it eight times in the words of inſtitution, beſides other places.</p>
